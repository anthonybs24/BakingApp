# BakingApp


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to a simple baking app for Android. It's part of the Udacity Android Mobile App Nanodegree program. 

## Design and Data
The baking app will load recipes from recipes.json file that is located in src/assets folder. There are total of 4 recipes: Nutella Pie, Brownies, Yellow Cake, and Cheesecake. On the main page of the app, users will see list of recipes that are available to them. When user clicks on one of the recipe, the app will take user to details page. In the details page, user will see title of the recipe, ingredients, and steps on how to make it. There's also video links for each of the step.

## Instructions
To install the app, I'd recommend to download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). After installing Android studio, download and compile the code. Then you can generate an apk file to install on an Android device or you can run it directly on Android Studio Emulator
